== Introduction

This repository presents some experience about java programming solutions to solve specific common problems.

The big tech ground would be microservice and java tech stack. Some topics here would be discussed and written to text.

- Microservice design
- Basic CRUD operation for recommendation
- Packaging
- Authentication
- Permission Design
- ...

We will focus on `How to` and `Why` rather than `Think in`, so each chapter may follow this pattern:

. Problems or goals
. Options
. Common preferred solution
. Examples

About solutions, some principle I want to call out here:

. Product ready and reliable are more important factors than others
. Example should be common and useful for rework
. Keep using the latest solution for the common problem
. Keep copyright clean for avoiding disputes
. Depth and seriousness

In the end, hope this repository can help some for your daily work.
